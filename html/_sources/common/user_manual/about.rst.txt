This is an open-source research application, |tool github link|, 
released under a **BSD clause 2** license, :numref:`lblLicense`. 
|app| focuses on harvesting and analyzing regional building information based on data from multiple sources to 
assist decision makings in various sections, such as urban plan, risk management, etc. 

In SimCenter, one of the successful applications of |app| is in assisting 
the assessment of natural hazards and their imparts on the built environment.
The increase in the intensity of natural hazards is magnifying the impact of such events on our society. 
In order to quantify and mitigate the risk due to the hazards and to prepare for the potential impacts in a region, 
it is necessary to analyze existing buildings that are pertinent to natural hazard analysis and risk management. 
However, gathering the building information in a region- or city-scale and analyzing them is a laborious and expensive undertaking.  


|app| provides a framework for building information generation/gathering to support regional hazard analysis.  
In this framework, different types of data are acquired from multiple sources 
and are fused to semantically profile each building in a region. 
Specifically, deep learning technique is employed to analyze street or satellite images. 
Pretrained convolutional neural networks shipped with |app| are capable of analyzing images and detecting building properties that indicate vulnerabilities to natural hazards.
A novel data mining tool is integrated to overcome the data scarcity issue, quantify the uncertainty and enrich the data repository. 
With this framework, building inventories of cities can be analyzed and the results provide the insights for further disaster and risk management planning and simulations.
