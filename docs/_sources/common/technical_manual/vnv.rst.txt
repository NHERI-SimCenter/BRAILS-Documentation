Verification and Validation 
=============================

This section provides the validation test results for the following ML modules:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 0

    roof
    occupancy
    softstory
    nfloor
   

.. note:: 

   1. Year Built Classifier is currently under active development and testing. More details about the training, modification, improvement, and validation of this module can be found `here <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/BRAILS/tree/master/brails/modules/Year_Built_Classifier>`_.
   2. Raised Foundation Classifier is currently under active development and testing. More details about the training, modification, improvement, and validation of this module can be found `here <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/BRAILS/tree/master/brails/modules/Foundation_Classification>`_.

.. note:: 

   DISCLAIMER: The modules are prototype implementation to purposely demonstrate the potentials of ML methods to help establish building 
   attributes and inventories for regional scale simulation. The modules are tested extensively using the data sets as reported herein for validations.
   Similar to ML applications in other domains, however, generalization and interference of the trained models to new and unseen data from different 
   geographical locations can often be difficult. generalization of machine learning models remain an active research area. Users should exercise cautions when the modules are used 
   beyond their intended purposes and trained model ability.
