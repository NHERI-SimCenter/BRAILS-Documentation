Occupancy 
==========================

Occupancy class is an important parameter for natural hazard risk analysis of a building.
The occupancy model in the current version of BRAILS is trained on a dataset consists of residential buildings 
that are classified into two categories: single-family buildings (RES1) and 
Multi-family buildings (RES3). Data of other occupancy classes are being collected and will be added to the new versions of BRAILS.
