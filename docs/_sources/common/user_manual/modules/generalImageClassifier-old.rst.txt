Generic Image Classifier
========================

The Generic Image Classifier module takes a list of images as the input, and predicts the classes of the images. 

In BRAILS, building attributes that can be inferred using this module include: Roof type, Occupancy class, Soft-story. 


Get the code
-----------------


.. code-block:: none 

    git clone https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/BRAILS.git

    cd BRAILS/brails/modules/Generic_Image_Classifier

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Train a model
---------------------

.. code-block:: none 

    python train.py --imgDir <IMAGE_DIRECTORY> --modelDir <MODEL_DIRECTORY>


IMAGE_DIRECTORY is the directory where you have your images for training


.. code-block:: none 

    IMAGE_DIRECTORY
    │── class_1
    │       └── *.png
    │── class_2
    |      └── *.png
    │── ...
    |
    └── class_n
           └── *.png


An image dataset for test that contains images of different rooves can be downloaded `here <https://zenodo.org/record/3986721/files/Roof_Satellite_Images.zip>`_.

    


MODEL_DIRECTORY is the directory where the trained model will be saved. 

It is better to run the above code on a GPU machine.




Predict
---------------------


Now you can use the trained model to predict on given images.

.. code-block:: none 

    python predict.py --imageDir <IMAGE_DIRECTORY> --modelDir <MODEL_DIRECTORY> 


The predictions will be written in preds.csv under the current directory.

IMAGE_DIRECTORY is the directory of your images. 

MODEL_DIRECTORY is the folder where you have your trained model saved.

You need also to specify the name of your model file by --modelFile <MODEL_FILE_NAME> if the name of your model file is not the default "classifier.h5".

You can specify the name of classes like this --classNames <CLASS_A> <CLASS_B> ...


Example: Roof type classification

A pre-trained model for roof type classification can be downloaded from `here <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4059083>`_.

This model takes a satellite image as input and predicts roof types (flat/gabled/hipped). To test it:

.. code-block:: none 

    wget https://zenodo.org/record/4059084/files/roof_classifier_v0.1.h5

    python predict.py 
            --imageDir <IMAGE_DIRECTORY> 
            --modelDir . 
            --modelFile roof_classifier_v0.1.h5 
            --classNames flat gabled hipped

Note that a module named Roof Classifier is shipped as a module in BRAILS, which is much more convenient to use.
Check how to use it here: :ref:`lbl-roofClassifier`.
